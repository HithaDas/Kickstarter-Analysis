# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns with Excel**

## **Overview of Project** - Performing analysis on kickstarter data to see outcomes so that Louise can make an informed decision.

### The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and the success/ failure of target funding goals.

## **Analysis and Challenges** - to have unbiased analysis we should find outliers so that Louise can have informed, realistic campaign goal.

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on launch Date** - the two conclusions are based on launch date data -
1. The campaigns from beginning of the year and/ or in summer months have greater success rate.
2. There is a spike is successful campaigns starting in March which goes till June, and eventually drops to the later of the year.

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals** - the conclusions on the outcomes based on goals shows the following-
1. Campaigns with lesser than 5000 dollars and between $35,000 to $44,999 were much more successful.
2. None of the campaigns between various range had any cancellations.

### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered** -Below are some challenges that I was encountered with this Analysis -
**Analysis of Outcomes Based on launch Date**
1. Initially i didnt understand that i had to extract "month" until i saw the sampel pivot table.
2. Similarly i had to fumble my way through to find a solution to hide "live" as outcoem was not shown in the sample pivot table.
**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**
1. I misread the COUNTIFS criteria requirements and initially didnt include data in subcategory "Plays"
2. The "%" sign on line graph on vertical axis also took some time.

## **Results**
The two conclusions i can draw withthe "Outcomes based on Launch Date" -
1. As we see in the line chart, summer would be the best time for Louise to start the theater campaign as the data clearly shows that during this period the most successful time for campaigns.
2. I wont suggest to Loiuse to start the campaign in winter months specially Dec.

The two conclusions i can draw withthe "Outcomes based on Goals"-
1. Having funding goal less than $5000 will have more percentage of success as seen in the line graph.
2. There is clearly zero chances of having cancellations in theater campaign.

**Limitations** 
The above analysis is based on sub-category "Plays" only to ahve better understanding the other sub-categories should be reviewed as well. 
Also, its not mentioned hwere Loiuse is based in? Depending on that the campaign strategy should ne analysed in detail.

**Other possibilities**
Create another line chart with use of pivot table for other sub-categories which fall under "Theater" to understand how the data looks to make an informed decison.
Find outliers in "Theater" outcomes to compare standard distribution.
